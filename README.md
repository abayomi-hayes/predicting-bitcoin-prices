using LSTM to predict stock prices
This project utilizes LSTM, a type of recurrent neural network (RNN), to predict Bitcoin prices. LSTM is well-suited for time series data like cryptocurrency prices because it can capture temporal dependencies in the data.
# Prerequisites
Before you begin, ensure you have the following:

Python 3.x

TensorFlow or PyTorch (for LSTM implementation)

Pandas

Numpy

Matplotlib or Seaborn (for data visualization)

Jupyter Notebook (optional for interactive development
